# 03-MEMOIZATION

## ANDREIA SHIN CWID: 884976077

## Project Overview

Step 1:

Your mission is to write a function that converts numeric money values to text strings. 

Money is represented as an integer, in cents ($1,223.09 = 122309).

This example would be translated to "one thousand two hundred twenty-three dollars and nine cents."

Step 2:

Memoize this function for all values less than $1500. (values greater than $1500 must be supported, but they don't need to be memoized.

Input/Output:

For all input lines (stdin) read a line that should have one integer (Money) on it.

Output the integer and the string representation: "4734 = forty.seven dollars and thirty-four cents"

(until EOF)

Turn in:

All source files, Makefile, TESTS.md, and a "tests.sh" file that runs some tests and outputs "success" or "failed" (with the failing test case). (and of course .gitignore, .clang-format, etc)

If you design/prototype with a Python file, feel free to turn that in too.
